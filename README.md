Handwritten image and its OCR'ed text file

1. Create your own paper document by writing a few numbers 
and words in 3-4 lines. Do not use cursive writing, instead 
use capital letters and right as neatly as possible. Here's 
an [example](http://j.mp/numberWords). 
2. Create a digital copy of the same (what will you use to 
create a scanned copy?)
3. Look inside the digital copy and examine it using a hex 
editor 
5. Do an **OCR** of your digital copy and download a text 
version of your digital essay. Write down and share what 
you used to do an OCR on your own handwritten document.
6. Send the digital copy and the text file (created using 
your OCR effort) to your faculty's email; 
7. Create a github repository containing a digital scan of 
your document and an OCR'ed text file of your document 
8. Bring the written document to class;  Bring a print out 
of the OCR'ed text file to class
9. If you do everything as per the steps above, you should 
end up with a snapshot of a cloned repo directory similar 
to the image below:
